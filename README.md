 nc-thm _(stands for: **n**ice-**th**e**m**e)_ is a piece of software that can manage, edit, import, export or remove theme. One of the nc-thm's key feature is that the theme can be applied globally, means the theme can used by apps that have implemented nc-thm.
 nc-thm is intended to be open-source, rich, and easy to use.

 #### So, let's get started!

 ## For Consumers
 os-thm is an easier way to change your theme globally for every single app that has implemented os-thm with a single click of a button.

 Make sure to have the os-thm Manager app installed, as it's supposed to be the manager for all os-thm themes. You can [download it here](https://os-thm.thatcakeid.com).

 ## For Developers
 os-thm is an easier way to make theme accessible to the user without worrying about managing themes, all of that _(adding, importing, removing, editing themes)_ are managed by os-thm, and the best part is, it's [open source](https://github.com/ThatCakeID/os-thm-android)!

 ### How to implement nc-thm to your app?

 (Note: for sketchware developers, you might want to use [os-thm-sketchware](https://github.com/ThatCakeID/os-thm-sketchware))

  - Add Jitpack repositories to your root build.gradle
  ```allprojects {
     	repositories {
     		...
     		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
     		...
     	}
     }
  ```
 
  - Add os-thm implementation to your build.gradle
    ```dependencies {
            ...
       	    implementation 'com.github.ThatCakeID:os-thm-android:3.0.3'
       	    ...
    }

    ```
    _..or if you have trouble while implementing the library, try downloading the .aar file in the package tab and import it as library on android studio._
 
  - Grant Read and Write External Storage Permission
 
 That's it.

 ### How to use the library?
 How to apply the current applied theme with os-thm
 ```java
 OsThmTheme currentTheme = osthmEngine.getCurrentTheme();
 myFab.setBackgroundColor(currentTheme.colorAccent);
 rootView.setBackgroundColor(currentTheme.colorBackground);
 etc...
 ```
 We are currently finding solutions for applying theme to be less tedious, and easier.

 That's it!
